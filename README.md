<p>More about the idea and why we built it:</p>

Diversity Category

Create something that allows college students from diverse backgrounds to make new friends from other cultures while doing short, 45-min (online) volunteer projects together.

1. Nonprofit organizations sign up and define short mini-projects that can be completed online. They then enter them into the system.

2. Students sign up to do projects. Students should be from different schools and countries. The student sign up page, when possible, should be in the student's local language.

3. When the projects get 2-3 people, it can be launched.

4. The nonprofit talks to the students and explain what needs to be done.

5. Students can talk with each other and play music during the project through Discord while they work.

6. The nonprofit follows up with a thank you to the students at the end. The nonprofit also gives an update in a month about the impact of the project.
